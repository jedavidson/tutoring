# Tutorial 7

## Some nice resources
- [Online BFS/DFS visualiser](https://visualgo.net/en/dfsbfs)
- [A Hamiltonian cycle visualiser](https://algorithm-visualizer.org/backtracking/hamiltonean-cycles)
- If you know a bit of graph theory/induction, [a proof of the Euler circuit/path existence theorems](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ggbaker/zju/math/euler-ham.html)
    - You don't need to know the proofs for this course, but if you're a maths person, this could be interesting.
