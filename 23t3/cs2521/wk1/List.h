/**
 * An interface exposing two linked list types and a common node type,
 * as well as a few helper functions to create a list from the command-line
 * arguments, show a list's contents and free memory belonging to a list.
 *
 * List is a plain linked list which is represented as a pointer to the head,
 * which is to say that lists themselves are indistinguishable from nodes.
 *
 * ConList is a containerised linked list structure that contains a pointer
 * to a plain linked list as described previously. In this way, there is an
 * actual difference in the representation of the list and its nodes.
